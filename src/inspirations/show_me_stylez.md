# Show me styles battles

"Show Me Stylez" was a series of battles before i even started breaking and it kept going unti like 2015 when wucypher got into trouble with their board for some money shit. I wish I had been around durign these, cuz this is how i want to remember breaking, not the weirdo way it is now. There are a lot of bboys who i wish i would have followed and appreciated more that were at these battles.

Just grabbing a bunch of my favorite battles and putting a few words about them here.

## BMF vs soulja boys

First off, Whispers MCing is the most dumb shit i've ever heard. Like what the fuck is a "mustache ride"?

I really love the complexity of monk's ground work and wolf's handwork on the ground

## ENI vs Self-X

- First off Data's way of getting out is fucking Tite.
- Wolf's pacing is on point

I think I met Airsick at the wrong time, that dude was nasty AF. Not too mention I actually prefer Vic in his younger days.
