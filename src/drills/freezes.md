# Freezes

A collection of drills that can be used to improve freeze strength and transitions.

## Clap Twice

This drill comes courtesy of Bboy Choi from "Take It Easy" crew down in Texas.
 It is most easily done with a partner. Basically just start in any freeze then your partner claps twice and you transition to a new freeze. Start by shooting for 10 freezes and adjust accordingly. The transition time should get shorter the more often this is done and the freezes should get stronger. If you crash during it just go to the next freeze immediatley. Turn the crash into a freeze.

## Red Light, Green Light
The breaking version of the kids game "Red Light, Green Light". Also best performed in pairs, one person will be doing sets (that dont include freezes) then the other person will occasonally say "Red Light" and the first person must get to a freeze as quickly as possible and hold it until the other person says "Green Light".
