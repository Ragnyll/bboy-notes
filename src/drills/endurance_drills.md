## The minute drill
There are all kinds of drills for stamina but I think the minute drill is the most effective. Basically you break for a whole minute, then have a shorter break. You can do it evenly with a partner, but unless your partner undercuts you it's not as effective.

The drill is this:
- Repeat 3 times
    - Repeat 3 times
        - Break for 60 seconds
        - Rest for 45 seconds
    - Rest for 180 seconds

The idea is to simulate battles where you have a very long round then your opponent undercuts you. The times can be adjusted to reflect different timings. I just think 1 minute is longer than most rounds will (and probably should) go anyways. If you can break for a minute, then 45s should be easy.

_Strategies_: Pace yourself and add frequent stylish pauses. The idea is to have as consistent rounds as possible. This can be done with freestyle or planned sets.
