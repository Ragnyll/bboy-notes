# Session

Breaking is such a weird sport where it requires a high level of all kinds of
strength: explosiveness, endurance, agility, and static strength. Training all
at the same time is very difficult thing to do. Focusing most energy in one
area is probably not a bad idea, but even that will start to suffer if the
other areas are neglected for too long. For example, right now i have been
training a lot of static strength, and that has gotten much better, but because
my endurance training has been lacking my statics training has started to
falter as well. As such, a well rounded practice regimen that also focuses on
breaking as the primary mechanism of practice is the way to go.

I think Rey had it right when he was saying that some kind of session every day
is the way to go. The way my style is developed though, I don't think dancing
every day is productive though. I think working in splits, where the split have
stronger focuses in one area might be the way to.

## Splits:
- Endurance
- Statics
- Explosiveness / Agility
- Creativity
- Flexibility

Again, training only one of these will lead to overall deterioration, but
training them all doesnt work either. It may be tempting to say "oh, that's 4
different days of training" but I don't think that's quite right either. For
example you might be training statics but that could include multiple moves
that you need to train multiple days a week to actually obtain.

So let's try to put together several sprints lasting 3 weeks each that puts
emphasis on 2 of the areas. 1 - 2 days a week should always be spent on
creativity or the context of why skills are being built is lost.

It's also worth noting that there are no days off. The "Rest Days" should be
spent stretching, analyzing, and planning.
