# 2024 Planning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2024 I desperately need to rework how I practice
breaking. This includes how I workout, how I operate at session, how I review
footage and how I plan rounds for battles and practice.

In order to figure out what I need to work on it's worth reflecting on what
works in my style, what doesn't and deeply cataloging them.

### So what do I like about my style?
- I have very defined signatures
- My threads are very sharp and have a few really intricate combos.
- My footwork is very crisp, and I have some really cool patterns.
- I can cover a lot of ground, directions and levels.

### What do I think I need?
- I'm missing stingers from a lot of footwork techs.
- I don't have enough dynamic/power moves
- A lot of my "in-between" moments look a little off.
- My rounds are kind of short
- My stamina needs work

The problem with this is will I be able to maintain the things that I like
while advancing the things that i need? I think that it is definitely possible,
but I need to be conscious of how I'm working. If I structure my workouts and
practices correctly, it'll work, but only if I keep the path.

So I guess I'll catalog all the moves I'm trying to get, what moves I have,
what purpose they serve, how well I have them, and what risk to my body (mostly
muscle fatigue wise) practicing them can lead to.

Lets break down real quick how I'm evaluating how well I have an individual skill.

| Score | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| 10    | Complete mastery. I can create unique signatures and have multiple ways in and out and do not crash|
| 9     | I have multiple ways in and out of this and can execute the move cleanly. |
| 8     | I can execute the move cleanly |
| 7     | I can do the move without crashing |
| 6     | I can do the move with some minor scrapes / crashes |
| 5     | I crash the move most of the time, but I'm getting the move |
| 4     | I crash every single time, my understanding of the move is low |
| 3     | I've tried this move a few times and crash it all the time. |
| 2     | I've never tried this move |
| 1     | What is this move? |


| Move | How well I have it | Main muscle group fatigues / hurt | Why I need it |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Swipe | 7 | Upper Shoulders / hips (minor though) | Fish out of Water uses it, and it's generally a useful move to stack from. It's an easy power move |
| Stab mills | 7 | Wrists Upper / upper back / neck (minor) | It's the foundation of all the mill moves I need to know. Also anything I catch a stab from would be a good candidate to start the mill from |
| Barrel Mills | 6 | Upper back / head / neck | If I can throw a few barrels and transtion to swipe i have all the stacked power combo I really need. Everything is just gravy from there |
| Munch Mills | 4 | Upper back/ head neck | It's a cool mill variation I would just like to have |
| Flares | 5 | Wrists | Shaolin flare kick. I can build a few other signatures from having it |
| 90s | 3 | Wrists / Upper back | I have decent handstands, stacking up to this would be tite |
|Backspin | 9 | Upper back (minor) | It's easy to use this to transtion to power to head.
| Handstand | 8.5 | Shoulders / Upper back | It's a good foundation for a lot of level change transitions |
| Baby | 9 | wrists / upper back | useful transtion for almost everything |
| Chair | 7 | wrists / upperback (minor) neck | I need it for Head Swipe and a lot of combos |
| Head Swipe | 5 | wrists / upperback (minor) neck | I can use it as a useful transition from footwork to freeze |
| Air Chair | 4 | Wrists / Shoulders | I dont have a lot of dynamic freezes |
| Air Baby | 4 | Writs / Upper Back Shoulders | It's cool, but i dont have a ton of use for it. Maybe going handstand to it just as workout |
| Shoulder -> Headstand | 8 | Neck / Upper Back | I have this move pretty well, and can use it as a reliable transition |
| Kip Up | 3 | Upper Back / Legs | needed for monkey moves |

The unfortunate thing about most of these is that they are all very upper back, shoulders, and wrist heavy. I kind of knew this coming into writing, and mostly was just looking for a way to prioritize, but seeing is a very different thing.

I think the move is to get moves that i have at a `6 or 7` to a 8 / 9. That way I can start looking for ways to really make the move mine. Having the move is nice, but having it doesn't really win me any battles. Additional weight should probably be given to moves where I already sort of have a strong combo out of it.

### Priority list

1. Chair
1. Swipe
1. Headswipe
1. Kip Up
1. Stab Mills
1. Munch Mills
1. Flares
1. Handstand
1. Barrel mills
1. Air Chair
1. Baby
1. 90s

I think this is a decent showing list of moves to get, and i think if i practice the right workouts then I don't need to drill the move every day. For example with flares there are plenty of hip workouts I can do on the days that I don't practice.
