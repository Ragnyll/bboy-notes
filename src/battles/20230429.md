## Reflections
All in all, not bad. The only majorly bad thing is that I slightly crashed the "shaolin flare kick." That move is kinda risky in general, because it requires that I catch my self off center to make it look cool. I just came out of it a hair to early and it came off as a crash. I had also planned on doing the fish out of water at the end of the round, but for some reason i think i just felt done. That would have been nice to be able to show my ground level, but the battle wasn't bad without it.

I think the major things I was lacking here were:
- a little more character in my top rock
- ground rock
- my footwork was kinda sloppy

I think all those are easy enough to clean up. I commit too hard to these combos and always forget to freestyle a little bit. I think if I come with a more clear mindset it should be easier to connect these ideas.

Not exactly something from my round perse, but I hella called Izzy's walk out. I thought that was cool. I wish JFinesse would have held our side when I made that call out. It just looked kinda unorganized when he did that. Nothin on him, i think disorganization is something that is kinda expected when you dont battle with someone consistently.
