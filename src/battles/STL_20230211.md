# STL 20230211

## Reflections:
This was a good jam to come back from my injury on after only about a month of conditioning. There were a lot of rounds for me and looking at my battles it's clear I dont have enough combos planned for each round. I had a good time, and there are def some good moments. I wish I could get a better camera angle on that shaolin thread kick. That seems to be a killer move i need to continue to advance. If I can get a flare -> shaolin thread kick that'd be hella nasty.

I don't have my prelim round, my parents werent there to film that, and I'm not sure which order my battles were in. All i know is that the one 15s clip is a cypher where i was just doing around then that punk started throwin cocks at me even though i wasnt even battling / calling him out, so I had to respond with my own little burn which I think caught people's attention.

I know I lost in semis to Xodus, but I'm not sure of the order otherwise.
