# Northwest Sweet 16 20230325

## Reflections:
It was a fun jam, and I've been perhaps overly tough on myself for my perfomance. Looking at my rounds i execute my moves, but none of the moves on their own are high enough difficulty to win rounds. On top of that there just needs to be way more moves per round. I do maybe 2 major moves in a set, but there should ideally be 5, and they should come in much quicker succession. So where as my rounds are about 30 seconds, they should round out to about 50.

I'm still looking for the full battles my crew (Rhytmiez (Rhythm ??? + Arch Enemies)) because i think those would be good to have, especially since they carried me.

I'm deeply appreciative of Nibz and Haze for pulling me in. I needed to battle to really hammer into my head how much more I need to be putting into these battle rounds.
