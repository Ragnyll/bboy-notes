## Puzzlez notes

- Round 1
- Right after his round my entrance killed him
- my swipe combo was wild, and the level change was crazy
- hit the freeze a little harder. it need the hump
- after the headstand freeze pindrop down and up
- **the get up doesnt match the round**
- some clippiness and the messiness in transition
- The double p freeze was nice!

- Round 2
- The fw and thread was on but it wasnt doing much damage
- it needed some stuff aroudn the fw
- combo that big middle finger burn
- double **everything** up
- after that legwork burn i make the point. knee drop down. but do less fw after this combo

- Back rocks coming up arent always good and the go ups arent always on

- my floor rock is east coast and chopped
    - in my rops dont dance as much. chop it up
