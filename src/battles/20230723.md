# Breaks and Brews 2023

- Overall I think the takeaway from this jam is that I need to work on my endurance and pull out my techs more reliably in later rounds.
- I also need some more blow ups and such.
- I can blame some of the endurance problems on it being so hot (100 degrees and sunny) but that should be a test of my best.

- All in all not a bad prelims round.
- I slip up a little bit and I recover.

## Top 16

- I need to start drilling flares again. The "Shaolin Flare Thread" is indispensable and really needed to round out my style which is already short on blow ups. I already have that move, and people love it so I need to bring it back.
- Already the repeats and exhaustion are setting in. This whole battle I do a lot of back side mountain climbers and
- I think my presence is strong, and I close out with great character. Cycle 6step a few too many times. I think that this is a sign I need to work on my endurance and making sure I'm able to pull out all of my techs each round.
- The ending is also pretty good here.

- I really don't think that I wont this battle. I could def see a tie, but not a straight win. I think that I take the first round by a good margin just from originality and presence but the second round I didn't do anything.
- Again, need to get used to using more of my content.

- Hella fun battle with Rey. I'm really gassed and out of content at this point and I think the only thing that carried 1 judge to a tie was the steez in the toprock.
- I had a plan coming into this battle and if I would have executed it I think i could have potentially forced a tie, but that energy Rey has is unfuckwitable.
