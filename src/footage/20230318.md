## Overall thoughts
- I have lot of "moments" but not consistently strong full rounds. I need to make sure i put 3-4 combos in every round and have different get ups and get downs
- keep using the windmill drop transition just get it crispy and consistent
- work on stack consistency and speed.
- keep working on that air chair
- use more air freezes and such. That may come with getting better at the stacks

- The windmill transition actually wasnt bad

- Honestly not a bad round, just kinda short
- the swag arms were actually really nice looking there

- it's not bad, just not enough content and it's a little simple
- also what the fuck happened to the music

- it's not bad, that wrist concept is kinda cool, but it needs to be part of something
- Also, that step when i reset my toprock actually hits kinda hard

- Thanks for the idea Rizzy. basically after that 2 step clap feet get up and do a slow bruce lee down.
- Also the shuffle and clasp hands freeze at the end is kinda steezy

- There was a good character moment in that

- honestly that was just kinda fun to watch. I dont know why its so hard to get the correct angle on the sex drop. but i think the sex drop has strong potentional for a get down

- not a bad round of toprock. needs more levels though

- Honestly the stop and pose moments are pretty good, same withe the character shit. i just need more substantive rounds. It's clear that i just need to make sure im getting those 3 combos in every round and making sure i hit the a well rounded set. I guess i just need to round out my freezes and shit and make sure that i'm executing it all
