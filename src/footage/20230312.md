Not much footage for this week. I'm just really starting to get on this shit again, so this is really mostly about getting back into the habit of analying my own videos.

### Notes:
- I gotta watch my posture a little more.
- Make sure I pace myself in that toprock
- The freezes arent bad but there's not much real substance to it.

### Notes:
- Keep working that airchair. It'll come
- The step back fall, pull is a cool concept. I should expand on that idea of just pulling myself around and call it **"The Fight Club"**

### Notes:
- Hands are wonky at time in toprock
- Get that drop to elbow steady
- The duck under idea is cool. keep it, then do that handstand up stack
