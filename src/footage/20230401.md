Only two clips this week. I was breaking more but didn't get a ton of times to record. I'm working on stringing together sets of 3-5 moves. Starting at 3 this week then moving to 5 in a few weeks. Once I get to that 5 point i'll have to make more new moves, but i need to memorize the ones that i have right now.

- A fun little session with Mel. Came up with this cool little kick drop that I'll have to save for later.

- This is a solid 3 move combo. It shows a decent amount of variety, but still needs some more dynamics. I think this is a good show of a starting point i need to eventually move into 5 move combos.
