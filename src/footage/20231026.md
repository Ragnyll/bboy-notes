## Overall:
### Good
- I like the sharpness in my tops (most of the time)
- Ground flow and freezes are massively improving
- Maybe i should fracture my thumb more often

Puz:
- ground work improving
- hit freezes more solidly
- the freeze isnt always steady, but the composition is good
- pacing the toprocks is good.
- swing freeze into mill and push that into everything else (and to head)
- the dust off ends are cool
- evolve the but drop

### Less good
- Certain freezes/transitions are inconsistent. Just keep working them (head <-> hand transitions) head swipes
- Use the puzzles moves more! The slide under figure 4 pull through thing is coming, just needs more workshopping
- too fast. wasting too much energy. slow down and show all my finesse. stick freezes longer.
- double burn more often
- sets are a little too short. work on cardio and BREATHING

Puz:
- focus on exit from freeze
- use the second freeze as the xit
- double up everything, the pillars

- I like the step over side chair, just gotta work it more. I hit freezes, but not super memorable ones.
- Puz- hit freezes harder

- that handstand is weak
- the thread through after the funny frog is hella sharp
- 1 step hop upfrom knee
- hit freeze harder

- head swipe doesnt look bad
- spin up aint bad either. guess puz was right
- the bounce step switch needs to be a little cleaner. hold the bounce a little longer

- tryna go for the puzzles figure 4 thing doesnt look good. come up with better entrance and exit
- puz - figure double freeze. play with the double freeze more

- starting out with a mid air level is good and those ground flows are nice since they stop right on beat

- get that mid handstand cleaner, the side to side kick touch is a nice texture. Try combining it with other fw later or a head swipe

- try and stick freezes longer, once i get good control there these are solid

- mill needs work but it aint bad
- double thrust burn was ok, but set isnt long enough for it to contrast well

- double burn the drop! it takes too long to get to the second burn

- work on that swipe height and the thread air chair
- the shirt thread is aight, it kinda breaks the flow in a weird way though the figure 4 down low is really nice and sharp. hold the second one longer though

- the back spin drop is aight, just stick the exit more consistently
- the speed on the ground threads is so nice! and ends with a freeze

- the toprock looked cool
- the puzzles thread burn still neds work
- that last little footwork tech has some nice dimension and is cool
