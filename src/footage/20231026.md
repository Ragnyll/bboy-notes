## Overall:
### Good
- I like the sharpness in my tops (most of the time)
- Ground flow and freezes are massively improving
- Maybe i should fracture my thumb more often
### Less good
- Certain freezes/transitions are inconsistent. Just keep working them (head <-> hand transitions) head swipes
- Use the puzzles moves more! The slide under figure 4 pull through thing is coming, just needs more workshopping
- too fast. wasting too much energy. slow down and show all my finesse. stick freezes longer.
- double burn more often
- sets are a little too short. work on cardio and BREATHING

- I like the step over side chair, just gotta work it more. I hit freezes, but not super memorable ones.

- starting out with a mid air level is good and those ground flows are nice since they stop right on beat

- get that mid handstand cleaner, the side to side kick touch is a nice texture. Try combining it with other fw later or a head swipe

- try and stick freezes longer, once i get good control there these are solid

- mill needs work but it aint bad
- double thrust burn was ok, but set isnt long enough for it to contrast well

- double burn the drop! it takes too long to get to the second burn

- work on that swipe height and the thread air chair
- the shirt thread is aight, it kinda breaks the flow in a weird way though the figure 4 down low is really nice and sharp. hold the second one longer though

- the back spin drop is aight, just stick the exit more consistently
- the speed on the ground threads is so nice! and ends with a freeze

- the toprock looked cool
- the puzzles thread burn still neds work
- that last little footwork tech has some nice dimension and is cool
